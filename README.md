# Logistic_Regression_Model_R
Aim is to build Logistic Regression model which will predict customer churn by applying the following steps: 
1. Find multicollinearity by applying VIF; 
2. Standardize features; 
3. Split data into train and test sets using seed=123; 
4. Exclude unimportant variables (information value should be > 0.02); 
5. Apply binning according to Weight of Evidence principle; 
6. Build a logistic regression model. p value variables should be max 0.05; 
7. Find threshold by max f1 score; 
8. Calculate AUC score both for train and test sets; 
9. Check overfitting.
